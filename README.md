1. Data Collection and Use

The Status Saver - Status Download app is designed to save WhatsApp statuses (images and videos) directly onto your device. We do not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user information. The app temporarily accesses device storage solely to perform its core function. No data is sent to external servers, collected, or processed beyond the user's device.

2. Permission Usage

To provide its core functionality, the app requires the following permissions:

MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:
This permission is necessary to access, save, and manage files on your device. It allows users to organize downloaded WhatsApp statuses into specific folders. This permission is critical for the app's functionality, and without it, the app will not operate as intended.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE:
This permission is required to read media files stored on your device to display them within the app interface.

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (for devices running Android versions below 11):
This permission is used to save WhatsApp statuses directly to the selected storage location on the user's device.

---

3. Data Storage and Security

All media saved by the app is stored locally on the user's device.

The app does not retain, transfer, or share any user data, files, or media with third parties.

Users retain full control of their saved files.

4. Childrenâ€™s Privacy

The Status Saver - Status Download app is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, solicit, or store any personal data from users in this age group.

---

5. User Responsibility

As a user, you are responsible for ensuring compliance with WhatsApp's terms of service and copyright policies when saving statuses. The app is a tool provided for personal use only.

---

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated to users via in-app notifications or updates to the app's listing on Google Play.
